## Keybinds & Features

| Hotkey | Action                                                                                                                                          |
|:---------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F1** | Start/stop recording. If pressed during playback, new events are appended afterward.         |
| **F2** | Playback recorded events. If custom code is injected (via F4), runs that instead.                   |
| **F3** | Export the full recording to `tas_output.ahk` in the script directory.                                        |
| **F4** | Open a **multi-line GUI** to paste/enter custom AHK code for playback override.              |
| **F5** | **Save** current recording to `tas_saved.txt`, or **Load** from that file on second press. |
| **F8** | Reset all in-memory data: recordings, playback buffer, and any injected code.                      |

## Workflow

1. **Record**  
   - Press **F1** → perform inputs in Roblox → press **F1** to stop.  
2. **Chain** (optional)  
   - Press **F2** to play back your last recording, then press **F1** during playback to append more inputs.  
3. **Export**  
   - Press **F3** → generates `tas_output.ahk` (ready to run as a standalone script).  
4. **Custom Playback** (optional)  
   - Press **F4**, paste your own multi-line AHK script, click **Save** → press **F2** to run it.  
5. **Save / Load** (persistent)  
   - Press **F5** → choose **Yes** to save current events to disk or **No** to load previously saved events.  
6. **Reset**  
   - Press **F8** to clear all recordings and custom injections.

## Files

- **`tas.ahk`**  
  Main script with all logic and hotkeys.
- **`tas_output.ahk`**  
  Auto-generated by **F3**: standalone playback script.
- **`tas_saved.txt`**  
  Auto-generated by **F5**: serialized event list for save/load.

---

## Customization

- Adjust the polling interval (`SetTimer, PollKeys, 10`) to change key-sampling frequency.
- Add more keys to the `keys` array near the top to record additional keys.
- Tweak GUI dimensions in the **F4** block to fit your screen.

---

## Key Notes/Pro Tips

- AHK can't read inputs made before **F1** is pressed. Make sure you begin inputs only after starting your recording.
- My code is shitty and uses the default Windows timings. You may need to cut up segments from the **F3** `tas_output.ahk` log to create a coherent TAS.
- While I tried to make it so pressing **F1** during **F2** playback would override the **F2** playback, this was more hassle than it was worth. Tweak existing inputs using **F3** and **F4** menus if possible.

## License

I'm gonna be real: I don't really care.
I'd ask that you credit me, but I don't have the time nor willpower to stop you if you don't.
Please credit me, if you could so kindly, when using this for public works.
